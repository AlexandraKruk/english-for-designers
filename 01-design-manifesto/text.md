# Design manifesto
## My thoughts about design
### 1. Brand Perspective
Perspective is how we see and understand things. A brand’s idea is its unique way of looking at the world, like Volvo focusing on safety or Coca-Cola on happiness. Design turns this idea into pictures or visuals that people can understand and feel.
### 2. Filtering the Important
Art and stories take away extra details to show only what matters most. Design does the same, focusing on the main idea to create something clear and simple that speaks to people.
### 3. Together
Design involves many jobs, like making logos or creating websites. Each person adds their part, and working together makes the results much better and faster than working alone.
### 4. Pattern of Ideas
When a team works on ideas, everyone adds something special, like threads in lace. Together, they make a complete and inspiring picture that shows many points of view.
### 5. From the Start
Design changes over time. Logos and websites need updates to stay modern and match new ideas. Each update isn’t the end but the start of the next step in creating something new.
