# Practicing Consistency  
Alex Kruk, UX/UI Designer

## Asking the Right Question  
My path into this field didn't start with Figma or interfaces – it started with a question:  
How can we make it easier for someone to navigate and feel at ease in the environment we create for them?

## Thinking in Environments  
My first education was at Mendel University, where I studied horticulture and landscape architecture.  
I worked with real physical systems: analyzing wind corridors, calculating shade, designing flow and ergonomics.  
My focus was always on designing spaces that work – even when no one notices them doing so.

> If a structure works well, people won't notice it – they'll simply move through it.  
> That's good design.


One of my school projects was the redesign of a historical inner courtyard.  
We had to integrate a modern elevator, preserve the architectural aesthetic, rethink pedestrian circulation, and create comfortable rest zones.

## Design Begins Before Any Click  
Later, I made the decision to leave the university.  
Not because it wasn't interesting – but because I realized:  
I could be more useful working in digital.
Interactions with systems happen constantly – and I wanted to improve that experience.

## What Matters to Me in Design  
- Design should feel quiet, not performative.  
- If a structure is working, it doesn't need to explain itself.  
- Trust is earned by consistency.  
- Repeating patterns, visual logic, and thoughtful structure show that someone thought this through – and didn't rush.  
- I don't design to impress – I design to support.
