# About me Hello! 
I'm Alex Zheglova, a curious UI/UX designer and systems thinker. I use creativity and empathy to create intuitive user experiences. 

From e-commerce to data dashboards, I zoom out for the big picture. Then, I dive into the crucial details. Balancing logic and intuition, 

I ask not just “What works?” but also “What feels right?” 

Let’s craft something exceptional together!
