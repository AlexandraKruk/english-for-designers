# Nugátovník: It Started with a Logo
*Hi, I’m Alexandra Kruk — and this story started with a small logo task that turned into a full branding journey. It’s about design, of course, but also about understanding the people behind the brand and learning through the process.*
&nbsp;  
## How easy is it to create a logo when you don’t even know who it’s for?
This is the most classic branding story: a client comes to you as a designer. Except — plot twist — you’ve never met them. Not even seen their face. How am I supposed to know what suits them? How can a logo be successful if I don’t know the target audience or the one actually paying for it?

> (In my case, it's the agency — so yeah, they’ve already paid.)

And then the project manager says:
> *"Our graphic designer (that’s me, lol) will make the most perfect, business-appropriate logo ever."*

Let’s not forget: this is the same business the client has been nurturing with love and care for three years. That’s not nothing. And just like that, the story of a logo turned into a full-blown branding journey.
&nbsp;  
## A Turning Point

Let’s be honest.  
This was only the second time I ever reached for a truly insightful source of design knowledge.

It took time to truly understand how professionals *"steal like an artist."*  
But sooner or later, whether through studio work — or just life — you find yourself drawn to the masters.

I started studying the work of legendary designers.

## Chocolate ≠ Just Brown

Okay. Logo’s approved.  
Now on to the “easy part”:  
> *"Chocolate = brown and warm tones, right?"*

Sure. But also… no.

The competitors? Already drowning in brown. Some even *have* the golden tree (no judgment).  
But me? I love contrast. Especially the kind that passes **WCAG AA+** accessibility checks.

So yes — there *will* be brown.  
But it’ll be dark, rich, bittersweet chocolate brown. Deep enough to care about.  
No compromises.

&nbsp;  
## UX & Midjourney Battle

But here’s the real challenge:  
**Chocolate melts. Especially in summer.**
Okay, not a disaster — we added a clear banner about **Chilled Shipment**.  
The nougat will arrive safe and sound. Promise.
![Frame 2071](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1f43f05-0f56-4a36-b749-d2759d3e4b62)


Then came **Problem #2**:  
No photos. Not a single behind-the-scenes peek.  
Really hoping this isn’t some dropshipping operation out of China…

So yeah — this turned into a full-on **Midjourney battle**.  
Trying to recreate the warmth of handmade, with zero visuals to start from.

![photo_6028205076788659848_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15381a1b-c5b5-407d-8d24-cf9e4fa5295f)

Those were our first attempts

We spent over **8 hours** fine-tuning scenes like:  
- Chocolate chips being poured into a stainless melter  
- Temperature check in progress, chocolate mid-melt  
- Liquid chocolate being spread and cooled on marble  
- Filling polycarbonate molds with a perfect glossy stream

Each step had to feel **real**, tactile, and calm —  
no flat lighting, no plastic-looking gloves, no stock energy.
It felt less like prompting and more like **directing a tiny film set**.

## A Sweet Aftertaste

Every detail matters — even after the product leaves the kitchen.

The wrapping paper follows the same custom pattern found throughout the brand, creating a sense of continuity and care. Twine, wax stickers, and tactile textures were chosen to reflect the handmade character of the product.

The gift bag? Subtle, but bold. Patterned, but balanced.  
Designed to be part of the experience — not just to carry it.

# Second draft version

 How easy is it to create a logo when you don’t even know who it’s for?

This is the most classic branding story: a client comes to you as a designer. Except — plot twist — you’ve never met them. Not even seen their face.  
How am I supposed to know what suits them? How can a logo be successful if I don’t know the target audience ~~or~~ the one actually paying for it?

> (In my case, it's the agency — so yeah, they’ve already paid.)

And then the project manager says:
> *"Our graphic designer (that’s me, lol) will make the most perfect, business-appropriate logo ever."*

Let’s not forget: this is the same business the client has been nurturing with love and care for three years.  
**That’s not nothing.**

And just like that, the story began — and became the core of my **bachelor's thesis** and probably my most grown-up, emotionally invested design job.

Inspiration smells like fresh ink

So… truth time.  
This was only the second time I ever opened a **real** source of design inspiration.

📘 *Decoding Logos* — freshly printed, still smelling like typography heaven. Highly recommend.  

<img width="281" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11 28 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89ccb56d-8d24-4b8e-83ed-44134ab2dc53" />


You might not "steal like an artist" right away, but the agency (**or life itself**) will eventually push you there.

I started soaking up the work of legendary designers. 

> **Honestly, I felt unworthy breathing the same air.**

<img width="472" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11 29 42" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da0919d6-8432-4219-9f9e-51a8ea26e1f4" />

<img width="497" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11 29 37" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce7ac9a-d6a9-44ec-b885-9c1810681df1" />


If I had to design those logos again, I’d scribble this under each one:
- *“Inspired by Escher.”*
- *“Modern Art Deco vibes.”*

Because let’s face it — every entrepreneur who balances nougat production, suppliers, SEO and taxes **probably knows William Lamb**, right?

Ah, and the golden tree? Yes, the client wanted one in the logo.  
But I do want their business to keep feeding their family.  
So... **golden tree = Freepik AI's problem now**.
Meanwhile, I’ve got a nervous Project Manager behind me. Very human. Very real.

So yes — there *will* be brown.  
But it’ll be dark, rich, bittersweet chocolate brown. Deep enough to care about.  
No compromises.

Buttons & Broken Fingers

Now for the *sweetest* part of the project: **buttons**.  
(Because that’s what everyone thinks UXers do all day, right?)

But here's the actual issue:  
**Chocolate melts in summer.**

No worries — we’ve got a banner explaining what **Chilled Shipment** means.  
Your **nougat** will arrive safe and sound. Promise.

Problem #2?  
No photos. Not even one behind-the-scenes shot.  
Really hope they’re not drop-shipping from China…

This turned into a **Midjourney battle**.

![photo_6028205076788659850_y](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86b6c0ea-7efb-4fab-994d-9a1bf9355d17)

And this is how they thanked me.

![Frame 3395](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435841ff-7ac8-454c-b822-ad94de210788)



But hey — nobody can say this wasn’t real.

Copy Love Story

Pop the champagne! 🥂  
The launch went great. We’ve even got photos.

And that’s when the *copy love story* began.

We give chocolate to those we love.  
Care surrounds me every day:
- The sincere support of a project manager  
- **My husband opening water bottles for me**  
- My best friend not getting mad at me being late (again)

![Frame 3372](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef6c52d2-e3d5-4e24-8b86-f83f9379f756)

Sweets are the most innocent and pure way to say:
> *I love you.*

**I just want to give you a moment of carefree joy.**  
Even if all I can do is gift you nougat — or remove a stain from your favorite shirt.

UX Designers Have Souls Too

This project reminded me that:
**Love = actions + time.**

And I hope this text reminded *you* that even UX designers have souls.

Now excuse me — I’ve got to go recolor buttons and tell the client their site won’t get into the  
**Google Shopping feed** if they keep using white text on beige buttons.
