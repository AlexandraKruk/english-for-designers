# About me 1 
Hello! I’m a UI/UX designer and systems thinker, pairing creativity with empathy to shape intuitive user experiences. 
From e-commerce to SaaS, I zoom out for the big picture while diving into details. 
Balancing logic and intuition, I ask not just “What works?” but also “What feels right?” Let’s craft something exceptional together!
