# Alex Zheglova | [About Me](about.md)
I'm Alex Zheglova, a curious **UI/UX designer** and **systems thinker**. I use creativity and empathy to create intuitive user experiences.

From e-commerce to data dashboards, I zoom out for the big picture. Then, I dive into the crucial details. Balancing logic and intuition,  
I ask not just “What works?” but also “What feels right?”

Let’s craft something exceptional together!
