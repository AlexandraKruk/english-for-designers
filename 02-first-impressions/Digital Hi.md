A strict legal magazine needed a fresh look for a school competition. I added a burst of bright orange for energy. I kept the design clean and crisp. I highlighted each chapter with a subtle orange backdrop. I animated the logo with a friendly orange dot. Then, I worked with a 3D artist to create unique mockups. We balanced a serious style with a touch of flair.

The client wanted a memorable logo for a chocolate shop—elegant yet simple. I combined the softness of chocolate with the shop’s initial. I set the name underneath in a clean typeface. I chose warm brown tones inspired by cocoa. After finalizing the logo, I extended the design to banners and their online store.  wanted every touchpoint to feel sweet and inviting.

### Perconal longreed project 
I aimed to create something bold and vibrant. It should merge a game-inspired look with the sleek energy of tech branding. The design, with AI images, neon lights, and futuristic armor, caught attention. It sparked curiosity. It got 1.8K views on Behance. It showed the power of imagination and boldness in every choice.
