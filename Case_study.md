Case Study Structure

## 1. How easy is it to create a logo when you don’t even know who it’s for?

This is the most classic branding story: a client comes to you as a designer.  
Except — plot twist — you’ve never met them. Not even seen their face.  
How am I supposed to know what suits them? How can a logo be successful if I don’t know the target audience ~~or~~ the one actually paying for it?

> (In my case, it's the agency — so yeah, they’ve already paid.)

And then the project manager says:
> *"Our graphic designer (that’s me, lol) will make the most perfect, business-appropriate logo ever."*

Let’s not forget: this is the same business the client has been nurturing with love and care for three years.  
**That’s not nothing.**

And just like that, the story began — and became the core of my **bachelor's thesis** and probably my most grown-up, emotionally invested design job.

## 2. Inspiration smells like fresh ink

So… truth time.  
This was only the second time I ever opened a **real** source of design inspiration.

📘 *Decoding Logos* — freshly printed, still smelling like typography heaven. Highly recommend.

You might not "steal like an artist" right away, but the agency (**or life itself**) will eventually push you there.

I started soaking up the work of legendary designers. 

> **Honestly, I felt unworthy breathing the same air.**

If I had to design those logos again, I’d scribble this under each one:
- *“Inspired by Escher.”*
- *“Modern Art Deco vibes.”*

Because let’s face it — every entrepreneur who balances nougat production, suppliers, SEO and taxes **probably knows William Lamb**, right?

Ah, and the golden tree? Yes, the client wanted one in the logo.  
But I do want their business to keep feeding their family.  
So... **golden tree = Freepik AI's problem now**.
Meanwhile, I’ve got a nervous Project Manager behind me. Very human. Very real.

## 3. Chocolate ≠ Just Brown

Okay. Logo’s approved.  
Now on to the “easy part”:  
> *"Chocolate = brown and warm tones, right?"*

Sure. But also… no.

The competitors? Already drowning in brown. Some even *have* the golden tree (no judgment).  
But me? I love contrast. Especially the kind that passes **WCAG AA+** accessibility checks.

> *(Dear diary, the pain is real: when sunlight hits the screen and the client chose white text on a beige button. True story. Not sexy, guys.)*

So yes — there *will* be brown.  
But it’ll be dark, rich, bittersweet chocolate brown. Deep enough to care about.  
No compromises.

## 4. Buttons & Broken Fingers

Now for the *sweetest* part of the project: **buttons**.  
(Because that’s what everyone thinks UXers do all day, right?)

But here's the actual issue:  
**Chocolate melts in summer.**

No worries — we’ve got a banner explaining what **Chilled Shipment** means.  
Your **nougat** will arrive safe and sound. Promise.

Problem #2?  
No photos. Not even one behind-the-scenes shot.  
Really hope they’re not drop-shipping from China…

This turned into a **Midjourney battle**.

And this is how they thanked me.

But hey — nobody can say this wasn’t real.

## 5. Copy Love Story

Pop the champagne! 🥂  
The launch went great. We’ve even got photos.

And that’s when the *copy love story* began.

We give chocolate to those we love.  
Care surrounds me every day:
- The sincere support of a project manager  
- **My husband opening water bottles for me**  
- My best friend not getting mad at me being late (again)

Sweets are the most innocent and pure way to say:
> *I love you.*

**I just want to give you a moment of carefree joy.**  
Even if all I can do is gift you nougat — or remove a stain from your favorite shirt.

## 6. UX Designers Have Souls Too

This project reminded me that:
**Love = actions + time.**

And I hope this text reminded *you* that even UX designers have souls.

Now excuse me — I’ve got to go recolor buttons and tell the client their site won’t get into the  
**Google Shopping feed** if they keep using white text on beige buttons.
